----- What is NoSQL Database? -----
NoSQL (non-relational) databases
	* Use document-based model (non-relational)
	* Schema-free document storage
		- Still support CRUD operations(create, read, update, delete)
		- Still support indexing and querying
		- Still supports concurrency  and transactions
	* Highly optimized for append / retrieve
	* Great performance and scalability

	
----- Relational vs. NoSQL Databases -----
Relational databases
	* Data stored as table rows
	* Relationships between related rows
	* Single entity spans multiple tables
	* RDBMS systems are very mature, rock solid

NoSQL databases
	* Data stored as documents
	* Single entity (document) is a single record
	* Documents do not have a fixed structure
	
	
----- NoSQL Database Systems -----
	* Redis
		- Ultra-fast in-memory data structures server
	* MongoDB
		- Mature and powerful JSON-document database
	* CouchDB
		- JSON-based document database with REST API
	* Cassandra
		- Distributed wide-column database
